## How to use

When new albums are released, start by making an [issue](https://github.com/SirenGlitch/Monopoly-Stickers/issues) titled something like "Fresh Album", containing sticker names, set names, and using tick lists (unchecked: `[ ]`, checked: `[x]`) to specify which stickers you may or may not already have at that point. This info will allow me to update your specific collection file accordingly.

When requesting a specific sticker, use the "Sticker Request" issue template, and fill in the boxes appropriately. Once your request has been satisfied (i.e. you have recieved the sticker), add a comment to the issue tagging me (@SirenGlitch), to bring my attention to the satisfied request, so I can update your collection and close the issue as complete.

### Note: in the event that any sticker requests are still unsatisfied once an album's time has come to an end, all remaining issues will be closed as "Unsatisfied"
